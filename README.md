#Pairfection
An application designed for people who want to plan the perfect meal in a short time. Users can pick the video of their choice, watch how to prepare the meal, and get wine recommendation for the meal.  

##Motivation
This was inspired for those days where I have friends and relatives coming over and needing to plan a meal that includes wine without spending unnecessary time scrolling through hundreds of recipes in countless of food sites and figuring out what wine to pair the dish with.
